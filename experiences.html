    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p class="page-desc">
        Over <strong>10 years of research experience</strong> in machine learning and computational biology, with an emphasis on
    <strong>developing novel AI methodologies for modeling biological systems</strong>, including antibody-antigen interactions,
    protein structure-function relationships, and therapeutic design.
    My work integrates <strong>large language models, representation learning, and interpretable machine learning</strong>,
    supported by <strong>6 years of university-level instruction</strong> in computer science,
    and extensive experience supervising research-driven student projects and interdisciplinary collaborations.

          &#8702; Conduct research on machine learning, representation learning, and generative modeling applied to protein and antibody systems, with an emphasis on scalable and generalizable model design.
        <br/>&#8702; Designed, trained and fine-tuned protein language models and contrastive representation learning frameworks to capture binding behavior and mutation-driven effects across antibody–antigen pairs.
        <br/>&#8702; Developed structure-aware learning approaches that integrate sequence and 3D structural information, demonstrating improved predictive performance over sequence-only models.
        <br/>&#8702; Built generative and discriminative ML pipelines for antibody interaction modeling, embedding learning, and binding classification across large-scale datasets (500K+ samples).
        <br/>&#8702; Created SPICE, an end-to-end, production-grade web platform for structural protein–protein interaction analysis, enabling comparative analysis of contacts, energetics, and geometric features across variants.
        <br/>&#8702; Published research in peer-reviewed journals, conferences and workshops (JCIM, PLOS, AAAI, NeurIPS) and collaborated with interdisciplinary teams spanning machine learning and computational biology.

        &#8702; Fine-tuned nucleotide transformer models to predict probe performance in hybrid-capture based cancer detection workflows, validating the feasibility of ML-driven probe optimization.
        <br/>&#8702; Analyzed large-scale experimental sequencing and assay data, translating raw outputs into model-ready representations and performance benchmarks.
        <br/>&#8702; Defined and implemented task-specific evaluation metrics, including sensitivity- and specificity–aware performance measures, to more accurately capture probe effectiveness in hybrid capture mechanisms.
        <br/>&#8702; Trained and evaluated predictive models achieving around 80% accuracy, providing quantitative evidence to support downstream research and future development directions.
        <br/>&#8702; Collaborated closely with interdisciplinary teams across machine learning, experimental biology, and applied research to align modeling assumptions with biological constraints.
