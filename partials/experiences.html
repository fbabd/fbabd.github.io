                    ￭ Conduct research on machine learning, representation learning, and generative modeling applied to protein and antibody systems, with an emphasis on scalable and generalizable model design. <br/>
                    ￭ Designed, trained and fine-tuned protein language models and contrastive representation learning frameworks to capture binding behavior and mutation-driven effects across antibody–antigen pairs. <br/>
                    ￭ Developed structure-aware learning approaches that integrate sequence and 3D structural information, demonstrating improved predictive performance over sequence-only models. <br/>
                    ￭ Built generative and discriminative ML pipelines for antibody interaction modeling, embedding learning, and binding classification across large-scale datasets (500K+ samples). <br/>
                    ￭ Created SPICE, an end-to-end, production-grade web platform for structural protein–protein interaction analysis, enabling comparative analysis of contacts, energetics, and geometric features across variants. <br/>
                    ￭ Published research in peer-reviewed journals, conferences and workshops (JCIM, PLOS, AAAI, NeurIPS) and collaborated with interdisciplinary teams spanning machine learning and computational biology. <br/>

                ￭ Applied and fine-tuned nucleotide transformer models to predict probe performance in hybrid-capture–based cancer detection workflows, validating the feasibility of ML-driven probe optimization. <br/>
                ￭ Analyzed large-scale experimental sequencing and assay data, translating raw outputs into model-ready representations and performance benchmarks. <br/>
                ￭ Defined and implemented task-specific evaluation metrics, including sensitivity- and specificity–aware performance measures, to more accurately capture probe effectiveness in hybrid capture mechanisms. <br/>
                ￭ Trained and evaluated predictive models achieving around 80% accuracy, providing quantitative evidence to support downstream research and future development directions. <br/>
                ￭ Regularly presented model results, analyses, and recommendations to research stakeholders, influencing project direction and next-phase feasibility. <br/>
                ￭ Collaborated closely with interdisciplinary teams across machine learning, experimental biology, and applied research to align modeling assumptions with biological constraints. <br/>
