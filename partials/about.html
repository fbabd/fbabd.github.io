  <p><strong>Hi, I'm Faisal Bin Ashraf.</strong></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">
    I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the <b>University of California, Riverside</b>, working under the supervision of
    <b><a href="https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~stelo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Stefano Lonardi</a></b>.
    My research focuses on developing machine learning methods for understanding and designing antibody–antigen interactions, at the intersection of artificial intelligence and computational biology.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">
    My work centers on large language models for proteins and structure-aware learning, where I integrate sequence information with three-dimensional structures,
    molecular interactions, and graph-based representations. I design models that predict antibody binding, capture the effects of antigen mutations,
    and learn biologically meaningful representations that distinguish functional outcomes across variants. A key theme of my research is moving beyond
    black-box prediction toward models that explicitly encode structural and physicochemical context, enabling reliable interpretation and downstream design.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">
    I have published in venues such as the <i>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</i>, <i>PLOS ONE</i>, and <i>Heliyon</i>,
    and my recent work demonstrates how structure-aware language models can reveal mutation-driven changes in antibody–antigen binding.
    In parallel, I develop practical research tools, including a web-based platform for comparative analysis of protein–protein complexes,
    supporting interface characterization, energetic analysis, and variant-level comparison.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Broadly, I am interested in protein language modeling, structure-based learning, graph neural networks, and generative models for molecular and antibody design.
    My long-term goal is to build AI systems that bridge machine intelligence with biological insight, enabling principled analysis and design of biomolecules
    for real-world biomedical and therapeutic applications.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Before joining UC Riverside, I spent over six years as a university lecturer in computer science at Brac University, Bangladesh,
    where I taught core undergraduate courses including Discrete Mathematics, Programming Languages, Database Systems, and Operating Systems.
    I am originally from

    a beautiful coastal city in Bangladesh.
